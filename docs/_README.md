# BRouter Docs

This documentation can be used to generate a static website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Dependencies

jekyll uses ruby and therefore installs dependencies using gem. It is recommended to use bundler to manage those dependencies.

`bundle install` installs all dependencies. To update dependencies use `bundle update`.

## Preview

jekyll provides a built-in webserver which can be used for fast feedback during editing.

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
