# Via-Points and NoGo-Areas

BRouter can process via-points and nogo-areas, and [brouter-web](/brouter-web)
offers on online interface to edit both of them.

Nogo areas are useful if you encouter an obstacle that is not contained in the
underlying map. But they can also be useful in planning alternative routes by
excluding e.g. a certain bridge or ferry.

For offline use, nogo-areas can be defined as wayoints using a special [naming convention](../users/android_advanced.md#using-nogo-areas).
Handling of via-points during offline use depends on the mode of operation, see
the README for details.
