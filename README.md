BRouter
=======

BRouter is a configurable OSM offline router with elevation awareness, Java +
Android. Designed to be multi-modal with a particular emphasis on bicycle
and energy-based car routing.

For more infos see [http://brouter.de/brouter](http://brouter.de/brouter).


## BRouter on Android

You can install the BRouter app on your Android device from
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/btools.routingapp) or [Google Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=btools.routingapp). You
can also [build BRouter](#build-and-install) yourself. You can find detailed
documentation of the BRouter Android app in
[`docs/users/android_quickstart.md`](docs/users/android_quickstart.md).

### Android with Locus

You can use BRouter as the offline routing engine for [Locus
Map](https://www.locusmap.eu/) on your Android device. This is currently the
most featureful and maintained solutions for using BRouter on your Android
device.

A full documentation on how to set this up is available at
[https://www.locusmap.eu/locus-map-can-navigate-offline/](https://www.locusmap.eu/locus-map-can-navigate-offline/).


### Android with OSMAnd

Alternatively, you can also use BRouter as the offline routing engine for
[OSMAnd](https://osmand.net/) on your Android device.

A full documentation on how to set this up is available at
[`docs/users/osmand.md`](docs/users/osmand.md).


## BRouter on Windows/Linux/Mac OS

### Build and Install

To compile the BRouter Android app, the Android SDK path must first be set in a file called `local.properties` in the main folder:

```
sdk.dir=<your/android/sdk/path>
```


Build BRouter with the Android app (if Android SDK path is set):

```
./gradlew clean build
```

Build BRouter without the Android app:

```
./gradlew clean build -x :brouter-routing-app:build
```

Build JAR file for server and map creator with all dependent classes:

```
./gradlew clean build fatJar # places JAR file in brouter-server/build/libs/
```

Build ZIP file for distribution with readmes, profiles, APK and JAR:

```
./gradlew distZip # places ZIP file in brouter-server/build/distributions/
```


### Get the required segments (data) files

Routing data files are organised as 5*5 degree files,
with the filename containing the south-west corner
of the square, which means:

- You want to route near West48/North37 -> you need `W50_N35.rd5`
- You want to route near East7/North47 -> you need `E5_N45.rd5`

These data files, called "segments" across BRouter, are generated from
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data and stored in a custom
binary format (rd5) for improved efficiency of BRouter routing.


#### Download them from brouter.de

Segments files from the whole planet are generated weekly at
[https://brouter.de/brouter/segments4/](http://brouter.de/brouter/segments4/).

You can download one or more segments files, covering the area of the planet
you want to route, into the `misc/segments4` directory.

#### Generate your own segments files

You can also generate the segments files you need directly from a planet dump
of OpenStreetMap data (or a [GeoFabrik extract](https://download.geofabrik.de/)).

More documentation of this is available in the
[`docs/developers/build_segments.md`](docs/developers/build_segments.md) file.


### (Optional) Generate profile variants

This repository holds examples of BRouter profiles for many different
transportation modes. Most of these can be easily customized by setting
variables in the first `global` context of the profiles files.

An helper script is available in `misc/scripts/generate_profile_variants.sh`
to help you quickly generate variants based on the default profiles, to create
a default set of profiles covering most of the basic use cases.

Have a look at the
[`docs/developers/profile_developers_guide.md`](docs/developers/profile_developers_guide.md)
for an in-depth guide on profiles edition and customization.


### Run the BRouter HTTP server

Helpers scripts are provided in `misc/scripts/standalone` to quickly spawn a
BRouter HTTP server for various platforms.

* Linux/Mac OS: `./misc/scripts/standalone/server.sh`
* Windows (using Bash): `./misc/scripts/standalone/server.sh`
* Windows (using CMD): `misc\scripts\standalone\server.cmd`

The API endpoints exposed by this HTTP server are documented in the
[`brouter-server/src/main/java/btools/server/request/ServerHandler.java`](brouter-server/src/main/java/btools/server/request/ServerHandler.java)
file.

## BRouter with Docker

To build the Docker image run (in the project's top level directory):

```
docker build -t brouter .
```

Download the segment files as described in the previous chapter. The folder containing the
segment files can be mounted into the container. Run BRouter as follows:

```
docker run --rm -v ./misc/scripts/segments4:/segments4 brouter
```

This will start brouter with a set of default routing profiles.

If you want to provide your own routing profiles, you can also mount the folder containing the custom profiles:

```
docker run --rm -v ./misc/scripts/segments4:/segments4 -v /path/to/custom/profiles:/profiles2 brouter
```
